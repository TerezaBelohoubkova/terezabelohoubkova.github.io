                                 Because of restructuring and my new role as a designer at SAP, my colleague Martin and I mapped out what our stakeholders think and expect from UX. Before I came to SAP no designer was assigned to only one project, so development teams weren’t used to working with a designer on a daily basis.
                                <br>We focused on learning what past experiences our colleagues had, what would be their ideal cooperation with UX and how advanced their skills with Figma are (mostly to build an ideal Figma structure).

                                At that time there was no other way to conduct the research. If I were to do it again, I'd ask a different colleague to conduct the interviews.

                                During interviews an interviewee would answer in a way that I knew they wouldn't be able to answer the coming questions. I had to improvise and edit the script 
                                on the spot to keep the conversation flowing and not make it seem like I was ignoring what the interviewee said. This was a learning to prepare questions in case 
                                the answer is not what I need.

                                Part of the research were scales where interviewees would place themselves on a scale from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree". Issue came when interviewees 
                                would have to answer where to place themselves. Because the points on the scale were named only the worst and best, they'd struggle to express their feelings.

                                After adjusting the scales to have numbers 1 to 5 assigned to the points, interviewees' expressiveness increased. Validation from a fresh eye would prevent this

                                Restructuring in SAP also brought on a big push for customer discovery before development. From our research we knew that stakeholders weren't used to doing user 
                                research and expected UX to only deliver mockups. 
                                <br>That's why we took data obtained during the stakeholder interviews and created a workshop for a group of developers and 
                                a group of product and development managers. The workshop's goal was to show stakeholders what the discovery process and consequently UX is about.
                                <br> Division of the group had it's reason: product and development managers would work with anonymized data from developers and developers would work with data 
                                of the managers.

                                At the beginning of the workshop, the attendees would get to know a persona of either a developer or product manager to enforce empathy and familiarize them with the concept.

                                on chosen criteria, ie. impact, effort, feasibility. A winner of this decision matrix was taken into journey mapping. In the last part of the 2nd session the group was supposed to validate 
                                their ideas but due to time reasons, I only showed a question creation guide.
